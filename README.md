# Pillager Raid Spawner
This is a Spigot plugin that spawns some Raiders every X minutes (where X can be a whole number between 1 and 60, inclusively).  
Raids are spawned for each player on the server, somewhere around the player at a random (but visible) location.

# Dependencies and versions 
This was developed and tested using Spigot 1.19.2 API (`org.spigotmc:spigot-api:1.19.2-R0.1-SNAPSHOT`). During the development Java 11 was used. During testing (on local Spigot server) Java 18 was used. Minecraft 1.19.2 was also used in testing.  

This project also depends on [my minecraft plugin utils](https://github.com/bymatej/minecraft-plugin-utils).

# How to install?
Just put the Jar file into plugins folder.  
The JAR file can be found in the [Releases](https://github.com/bymatej/PillagerRaidSpawner/releases).

## Are there any permissions needed?
Only `raid.control` permission is needed.  
If you don't care about the permissions, just make yourself an OP on the server.

# How it works?
You have one command that's used to start and stop the raid. Once the start command is executed, the raid is spawned every X minutes. X is the number of minutes, and it is defined in the command itself. Omitting the amounts of minutes defaults to 2 minutes.

## Command
Example command: `/raid start 5`  
This would start a Raid every 5 minutes.

### Command arguments
Command is `/raid` and the arguments are as follows:

#### Start raid command
| Argument position | Command argument            | Optional? | Default value | Description                                                    |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | --------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1st argument      | `start`                     | false     | `-`           | Starts the raid                                                |
| 2nd argument      | from `1` to `60`            | true      | `2`           | Number of minutes after every raid will spawn                  |
| 3rd argument      | from `0.01` to `0.99`       | true      | `0.05`        | Increment of difficulty (hardness) - increments on every spawn |
| 4th argument      | `true`, or `false`          | true      | `false`       | Flag to ignore the increments of difficulty (hardness)         |
| 5th argument      | `easy`, `medium`, or `hard` | true      | `medium`      | Difficulty level                                               |

Starting the raid does the following: 
- Spawns Raiders
- Starts a repeating task that spawns the raid every X minutes
- Makes a sound, and prints a message to server (broadcast) on every raid start

##### Arguments explanation
1st argument is self-explanatory. It indicates that the raid should be started, rather than stopped.  


2nd argument represents the number of minutes. The default value is `2` minutes. That means that every 2 minutes a new Raid will spawn around each player on the server.  


3rd argument represents the increment value for the hardness. It's called "hardness", as difficulty level is another feature.  
The starting number is always `1.0`. Every time a raid is spawned, the hardness is increased by the value specified in the command.  
If the value is `0.8`, then it will increment by `0.8` on every spawn. When the total sum (of 1.0 + 0.8 on each spawn) amounts to number with a new integer number, then this integer is taken and set as a Raiders spawn multiplier.  
We start at `1.0`. The Raiders are spawned. We increase `1.0` by `0.8`. That is now `1.8`. On the next spawn it is increased by `0.8` again. So after that spawn it's `2.6`. Now the new integer is not `2` (from `2.6`). That is our new multiplier. On the next spawn it's `3.4`, so the multiplier is `3`. And so on...  
Now, when the multiplier is greater than 1, the Raiders spawns are multiplied by that number. For example, if we get only 4 Raiders initially, when the multiplier is `3`, then we would get 4 times `3` Raiders. That means that our regular spawn amount is multiplied by our multiplier. And thus, the difficulty (or hardness) is increased!  
The default value is `0.05`, and possible values are between `0.01` and `0.99`.  


4th argument is a flag that can be used to ignore the hardness increment and spawn multiplier logic. The default value is `false`.  


5th argument is the difficulty. This is not the hardness feature (from the 3rd argument). This difficulty defines the difficulty of one Raid.  
The difficulty defines: 
- The number of Raiders that spawn
- The type of Raiders that spawn
- The speed of Raiders  

The default value is `medium`, and all possible values are `easy`, `medium`, and `hard`.  
Meaning of each difficulty level:  

| Difficulty | Number of raiders that spawn | Possible type of Raiders that may spawn                  | Speed of raiders                | 
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `easy`     | `3`                          | Pillager, Vindicator                                     | `0.01` more than the base speed |
| `medium`   | `4`                          | Pillager, Vindicator, Witch                              | `0.05` more than the base speed |
| `hard`     | `8`                          | Pillager, Vindicator, Witch, Ravager, Illusioner, Evoker | `0.10` more than the base speed |


##### Useful information
The Raiders that are spawned are randomized. If you noticed the "Possible type of Raiders that may spawn" column in the previous table, those are the Raiders "spawnable" based on the difficulty. And which Raider will be spawned on each Raid is random. On `medium` difficulty one Raid may be "Witch, Pillager, Pillager, Pillager", on another it can be "4 Pillagers", and on another it can be "Vindicator, Witch, Pillager, Vindicator". As said - it's random every time.  

Raiders are spawned per online player on the server. This means that if there is 1 player on the server, and the difficulty is on `medium`, 4 Raiders will spawn upon initiating the command.  
If there are 3 players on the server, 4 Raiders will spawn for each player. That means 4Ã—3 = 12 Raiders in total.


##### Command examples
- `/raid start` (start the raid with default values - same as `/raid start 2 0.05 false medium`)
- `/raid start 5` (start the raid with only minutes defined, and the rest of the values are the default values - same as `/raid start 5 0.05 false medium`)
- `/raid start 5 0.20` (start the raid with minutes and hardness increment defined, and the rest of the values are the default values - same as `/raid start 5 0.20 false medium`)
- `/raid start 5 0.20 true` (start the raid with minutes, hardness increment, and hardness flag defined, and the rest of the values are the default values - same as `/raid start 5 0.20 true medium`)
- `/raid start 5 0.20 false easy` (start the raid with all values customised (non-default values))

#### Stop raid command
| Argument position | Command argument | Optional? | Description    |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| 1st argument      | `stop`           | false     | Stops the raid |

Stopping the raid removes the Bad Omen effect for all players, and kill all the Raiders in the "radius" (square) of 150/100/150 blocks from each player.

##### Command examples
- `/raid stop`
